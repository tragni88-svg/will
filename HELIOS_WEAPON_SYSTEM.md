# Helios Weapon System: Core Technology

## 1. Power Source: Compact Fusion Cell

All Helios weapons are powered by a standardized, rechargeable Compact Fusion Cell (CFC). This is a small, incredibly dense power source that uses a laser-induced, contained fusion reaction to generate a massive amount of energy. 

*   **Energy Density:** A single, fully charged CFC holds enough energy for approximately 500 rifle shots, 1,000 pistol shots, or 100 sniper shots.
*   **Rechargeability:** CFCs can be recharged at a standard military power station or, in the field, via a portable solar-energy blanket (a full field recharge takes approximately 4 hours).
*   **Safety:** The fusion reaction is contained within a magnetic bottle. If the cell is breached, the reaction immediately ceases, preventing a catastrophic explosion.

## 2. Projectile Technology: Photonic-Kinetic Hybrid (PKH)

The energy from the CFC is no longer just used to "pump" a crystal for a continuous beam. Instead, the Helios system utilizes a revolutionary **Photonic-Kinetic Hybrid (PKH)** drive.

*   **Ballistic Laser Packets:** The system condenses high-energy photons into a super-dense, magnetically contained "bullet" of coherent light. This projectile travels at 99.9% the speed of light but behaves physically like a solid slug.
*   **Kinetic Impact:** Unlike traditional lasers that only burn, the PKH round delivers massive kinetic energy upon impact, capable of knocking back targets and shattering ceramic armor plates like a heavy-caliber ballistic round.
*   **Thermal Shock:** Upon penetration, the magnetic containment field collapses, releasing the stored photonic energy in a micro-second. This causes instantaneous superheating of the target's internal structure, resulting in a "flash-expansion" effect that is exponentially more lethal than standard ballistic or laser wounds.
*   **Variable Lethality:** The system can still modulate output, but the "Training Mode" now fires non-lethal, kinetic "stun" bolts, while "Combat Mode" delivers the full PKH payload.

## 3. Cooling System: Cryo-Capacitor Heat Sink

Managing heat is the single biggest challenge in a directed-energy weapon. The Helios system uses a revolutionary Cryo-Capacitor Heat Sink.

*   **Function:** Instead of just venting heat, this system absorbs the thermal energy from the PKH drive and stores it in a series of supercooled capacitors. 
*   **Discharge:** The stored heat can be discharged in two ways:
    1.  **Passive Venting:** A slow, silent release of heat over time.
    2.  **Emergency Purge:** A rapid, one-shot discharge of all stored heat in a visible, shimmering wave. This is a tactical last resort, as it reveals the user's position.
*   **Overheating:** If the heat sink reaches maximum capacity, the weapon will automatically enter a temporary shutdown mode to prevent damage.
