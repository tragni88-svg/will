## REVEAL CONCEPT

### "Aggressive Elegance" Theme
The reveal will showcase the EXT-V as the embodiment of "Aggressive Elegance"—a vehicle that fuses the raw power of a 700hp supercharged V8 with the sophisticated design language of modern Cadillac luxury.

**Narrative Arc:**
1. **The Legacy:** A brief, artistic nod to Cadillac's performance heritage (V-Series).
2. **The Tension:** The market is saturated with trucks that are either powerful or luxurious, but never both.
3. **The Fusion:** The EXT-V is revealed in stunning "Velocity Yellow," a color as bold as its performance.
4. **The Proof:** A showcase of its key features: the roar of the V8, the seamless 38-inch OLED, and the intricate carbon fiber details.

### Visual Spectacle
- **Stage Design:** A minimalist, dark stage with polished concrete floors and architectural lighting to make the yellow paint pop.
- **Lighting:** A dramatic, choreographed light show that traces the sharp, faceted lines of the truck before the full reveal.
- **The Reveal Moment:** The EXT-V is unveiled not under a silk sheet, but from within a cube of projected light and smoke, which shatters and dissipates to reveal the truck in all its glory.
- **Hero Color:** The "Velocity Yellow" paint will be the undeniable star of the show, emphasized by all lighting and background visuals.

### Demonstration Elements
1. **Static Reveal:** Dramatic unveiling with synchronized lighting
2. **Dynamic Display:** Vehicle drives on stage under own power
3. **Technology Showcase:** Live OLED demonstration
