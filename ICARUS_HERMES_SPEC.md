# Project Icarus: "Hermes" Manned Spaceplane Specification

## 1. Overview
The **Hermes X-1** is the first manned vehicle powered by the Graviton Displacement Drive (GDD). It serves as a proof-of-concept for both terrestrial heavy-lift logistics ("Sky-Lifter" program) and interplanetary transit ("Star-Skipper" program).

## 2. Technical Specifications

*   **Class:** Experimental Anti-Gravity Spaceplane
*   **Crew:** 4 (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Flight Engineer, Payload Specialist)
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Length: 24 meters
    *   Wingspan: 18 meters (Delta-wing configuration for atmospheric stability, though not required for lift)
    *   Dry Weight: 12,000 kg
*   **Powerplant:**
    *   **Primary:** 2x GDC-Mk2 Cores (Twin-Drive Configuration for redundancy)
    *   **Power Source:** Onboard "Helios-Max" Compact Fusion Reactor (Output: 3.5 GW)

## 3. Performance Capabilities

*   **Propulsion:**
    *   **Atmospheric Top Speed:** Mach 25+ (The gravity bubble eliminates air resistance/sonic booms).
    *   **Space Acceleration:** Constant 1G to 10G (Variable).
*   **Range:** Effectively unlimited (constrained only by life support and fusion fuel).
*   **Ceiling:** None (Orbital/Interplanetary capable).

## 4. Systems

*   **Hull:** Carbon-Tri-Titanium weave, reinforced with a metamaterial mesh to shape the gravity field.
*   **Life Support:** Closed-loop air recycling system (borrowed from the ISS program).
*   **Inertial Dampening:** The crew compartment sits within the "zero-point" of the gravity well, meaning the crew experiences 1G down (simulated gravity) regardless of the ship's actual acceleration.

## 5. Mission Profile: "Flight 01"

*   **Objective:** Achieve Low Earth Orbit (LEO), perform a lunar flyby, and return to Wardenclyffe Base.
*   **Duration:** 6 Hours.
*   **Payload:** Sensor suite to map the Higgs field topology during transit.
