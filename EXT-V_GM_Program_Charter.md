# GM Vehicle Program Charter – CONFIDENTIAL
## Program Code: **Cadillac EXT Program (EXT-V & EXT-E)**

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Strategy:** Establish a two-pronged assault on the luxury truck market by launching a gasoline-powered supertruck (EXT-V) and an all-electric supertruck (EXT-E).
- **EXT-V (ICE):** Target 30k units/yr at $95k-$105k MSRP, aimed at Raptor R/TRX buyers. Uses modified T1XX architecture for cost efficiency (<$1B program spend).
- **EXT-E (EV):** Target 20k units/yr at $120k-$140k MSRP, aimed at Hummer EV, Rivian R1T, and Cybertruck. Leverages the Ultium platform to create a halo vehicle for Cadillac's EV transition (est. $1.2B program spend).
- **Total Program:** A combined investment of over $2.1B to secure leadership in both the present and future luxury truck markets.

### 2. Customer & Market
**Primary:** Affluent lifestyle truck buyers (HHI > $200 k) seeking luxury + super-truck performance.  
**Secondary:** Cadillac loyalists needing utility without leaving the brand.  
**Competitive Set:** Raptor R, Ram TRX, GMC Sierra Denali Ultimate, electric trucks (Rivian R1T, Silverado EV RST).

**Key Clinics (Q3 CY-25):**  
- 700 hp supercharged V8 > 4.0 s 0-60 benchmark beats all ICE competitors.
- 38-inch curved OLED dash rated “industry first” and “purchase driver” by 68 % of clinic respondents.
- Air-Ride Adaptive + Magnetic Ride Control delivers best-in-class ride comfort vs. TRX/Raptor R on broken-pavement loop.
