# Windows 12 Ecosystem & Deployment Plan

## 1.0 Objective

To ensure a smooth, successful, and widespread adoption of Windows 12 by orchestrating a three-pronged strategy focused on hardware partners, software developers, and a phased public rollout. Our goal is to have 100 million devices running Windows 12 within the first 12 months of launch.

## 2.0 Hardware Partner (OEM & Silicon) Engagement

-   **Timeline:** Begins Immediately (M1)
-   **Strategy:** Deep, early co-engineering is critical for the success of the Min-Kernel and Polaris AI subsystems. We will create a tiered partner program.
    -   **Tier 1 (Alpha Partners):** Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm. These partners get access to the Min-Kernel source code, the Helios Scheduler, and the Cortex Orchestrator specifications under a strict NDA. The goal is to influence silicon design for optimal Windows 12 performance.
    -   **Tier 2 (Launch Partners):** Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft Surface. These partners will receive early builds of the OS and dedicated engineering support to design and build a portfolio of "Windows 12 Optimized" launch devices.
-   **Key Deliverable:** A range of "Windows 12 Signature Devices" available on launch day, showcasing the best of the new OS (Glass UI at 8K, AI-powered features, instant-on performance).

## 3.0 Developer & ISV Engagement

-   **Timeline:** Begins at Month 7 (coinciding with Min-Kernel SDK release)
-   **Strategy:** Generate excitement and provide developers with the tools they need to build next-generation applications.
    -   **'Dev-Edition' Release:** A special version of Windows 12, delivered as a virtual machine, will be released to all Windows Insider for Developers members. This will include the new Min-Kernel Driver Development Kit (DDK) and the WinUI 4.0 SDK.
    -   **App Assure 2.0:** A new, AI-powered App Assure program will be launched to automatically test and identify compatibility issues with existing Win32 and UWP applications. The goal is 99.9% compatibility for existing apps with no developer intervention.
    -   **'Polaris' API Challenge:** A developer competition with significant cash prizes to encourage the creation of innovative apps that leverage the Polaris AI subsystem and the Glass UI.

## 4.0 Phased Public Rollout

-   **Timeline:** Begins at Month 13
-   **Strategy:** A gradual, data-driven rollout to ensure stability and gather feedback. The rollout will be managed by an AI model that identifies the most suitable PCs for the upgrade based on hardware configuration and stability metrics.

### Rollout Schedule:

1.  **Canary Channel (M13):** The very first external builds. Highly unstable. For technical experts and developers only.
2.  **Dev Channel (M15):** Weekly builds with new features. More stable than Canary but still with rough edges.
3.  **Beta Channel (M18):** Monthly, feature-complete builds. This is the first look at the final product. Focus is on stability and bug fixing.
4.  **Release Preview (M21):** The final, production-ready build, released to Insiders about a month before the public launch. Used for final validation with a broad audience.
5.  **General Availability (GA - M22):** Windows 12 is officially launched. New "Signature Devices" go on sale. The free upgrade begins rolling out to eligible PCs, starting with the newest and most compatible hardware first.

## 5.0 Marketing & Messaging

-   **Core Message:** "Windows 12: The AI-Powered OS. Faster, Smarter, and More Secure than Ever Before."
-   **Campaigns:** A major marketing campaign will launch two months before GA, highlighting the key pillars: Speed (Min-Kernel), Intelligence (Polaris AI), and Beauty (Glass UI).
