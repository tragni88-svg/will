# Helios Rifle: H-R1 "Arbiter"

## 1. Overview

The Arbiter is the workhorse of the Helios platform. It is a versatile, select-fire assault rifle designed for mid-range engagements. Utilizing the new **PKH (Photonic-Kinetic Hybrid)** drive, it fires super-dense packets of coherent light that strike with the force of a 7.62mm round and the thermal lethality of plasma.

## 2. Specifications

*   **Designation:** H-R1 (Helios-Rifle, Model 1)
*   **Nickname:** "Arbiter"
*   **Power Source:** 1 x Compact Fusion Cell (CFC)
*   **Optimal Range:** 50 - 600 meters
*   **Fire Modes:** Semi-Automatic, 3-Round Burst, Fully-Automatic
*   **Rate of Fire (Full Auto):** 700 RPM (Rounds Per Minute)
*   **Sighting System:** Comes standard with a holographic sight that digitally displays the remaining battery life and heat level. The top rail is compatible with a wide range of optics.

## 3. Key Features

*   **Modular Design:** The Arbiter features a universal rail system that allows for the attachment of various modules, including foregrips, laser sights (for targeting, not damage), and tactical lights.
*   **Underslung Grenade Launcher (Optional Module):** A popular attachment is a single-shot launcher that fires a plasma grenade. This grenade is powered by the main CFC but uses a significant amount of energy (equivalent to 50 rifle shots).
*   **Ergonomics:** The stock is adjustable, and the weapon is perfectly balanced, with the CFC located just behind the pistol grip to act as a counterweight to the forward laser assembly.
*   **Armor Penetration:** The PKH rounds are specifically tuned to shatter modern ceramic and composite armor. The kinetic impact fractures the plate, while the thermal payload instantly superheats the underlying layers.
