# Design Brief: The Cadillac EXT-V

## 1. Project Vision

To create a new flagship vehicle for Cadillac that redefines the luxury truck segment. This vehicle, the **Cadillac EXT-V**, will be a seamless fusion of uncompromising capability, bold, futuristic design, and the unparalleled luxury that is synonymous with the Cadillac brand. It is not just a truck; it is a statement.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** High-net-worth individuals, entrepreneurs, and established professionals who demand both utility and luxury. They are current luxury SUV owners (Escalade, Navigator, Range Rover) who desire more capability without sacrificing comfort or prestige.
*   **Secondary:** Affluent adventurers and families who need a vehicle that can tow a boat to the lake house on Friday, command respect at a business dinner on Saturday, and handle any terrain with confidence.

## 3. Core Design Principles

*   **Unmistakably Cadillac:** The design language must be an evolution of Cadillac's current aesthetic—sharp lines, vertical lighting, and an imposing presence. It must be instantly recognizable as a Cadillac, even from a distance.
*   **Commanding Presence:** The truck should have a powerful, athletic stance. It needs to look capable and luxurious simultaneously.
*   **Sanctuary of Luxury:** The interior must be a technological and artisanal masterpiece. It will borrow heavily from the Escalade's interior design, with a focus on premium materials, a seamless digital cockpit, and absolute comfort.
*   **Effortless Power:** Performance should be a key attribute. The EXT-V will feature a powertrain that delivers massive torque and horsepower, making it one of the most powerful trucks in its class.

## 4. Key Competitors

*   Ford F-150 Limited / Platinum
*   Ram 1500 Tungsten / TRX
*   GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate
*   Rivian R1T

## 5. Mandatories

*   **Powertrain:** Must offer a high-performance V-series option.
*   **Interior:** Must feature a pillar-to-pillar OLED screen array, similar to the Escalade.
*   **Technology:** Must include Super Cruise, GM's hands-free driving assistance technology.
*   **Capability:** Must have a competitive towing and payload capacity for its class.
