# Counter-Strike 3: Announcement Trailer Script

**[SCENE START]**

**0:00-0:05 - (AUDIO: Ominous, atmospheric music starts low and builds)**

*   **VISUAL:** A slow, cinematic pan across a highly detailed, 10K render of the new AK-47 skin, the "SAR-21." The camera focuses on the intricate details of the weapon, showcasing the PBR materials and 4K textures.

**0:05-0:15 - (AUDIO: Music builds, sound of a magazine being inserted, a single gunshot echoes)**

*   **VISUAL:** A rapid-fire montage of professional CS:GO plays, recreated in the Source 2 engine. We see s1mple's famous AWP no-scope on Cache, coldzera's jumping AWP shot on Mirage, and other iconic moments, all rendered in stunning 10K.

**0:15-0:25 - (AUDIO: Music shifts to a high-energy, electronic track. Sound of rapid gunfire and explosions.)**

*   **VISUAL:** The trailer cuts to gameplay on the new map, "de_foundry." We see a Terrorist team executing a fast-paced rush onto the A-site, using smoke grenades and flashes to push back the Counter-Terrorists. The camera follows an entry fragger as they clear the site, showcasing the fluid movement and 1.6-inspired recoil.

**0:25-0:35 - (AUDIO: Music intensifies. Voiceover from a professional commentator.)**

*   **COMMENTATOR (V.O.):** "The legend is reborn. A new era of competitive Counter-Strike has begun."
*   **VISUAL:** A split-screen shot shows a player in *CS 1.6* controlling a spray pattern, perfectly mirrored by a player in *CS3* doing the same. The visual parallel emphasizes the return to predictable recoil.

**0:35-0:45 - (AUDIO: Music reaches its peak. Sound of a bomb being planted.)**

*   **VISUAL:** A tense, 1v1 clutch situation on the B-site of de_foundry. The camera cuts between the perspectives of both players, highlighting the new dynamic hitbox system with a subtle visual effect that shows the per-polygon accuracy of a headshot.

**0:45-0:55 - (AUDIO: Music cuts out, leaving only the sound of a ticking bomb and a defuse kit being used.)**

*   **VISUAL:** The Counter-Terrorist gets the defuse with a fraction of a second to spare. The screen cuts to black.

**0:55-1:00 - (AUDIO: A single, powerful chord strikes.)**

*   **VISUAL:** The *Counter-Strike 3* logo appears on screen, followed by the text: "COMING SOON."
