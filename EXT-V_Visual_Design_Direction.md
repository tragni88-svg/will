# Cadillac EXT-V: Visual Design Direction

## 1. Design Philosophy: "Aggressive Elegance"

The design of the EXT-V is a fusion of raw, untamed power and sophisticated, modern luxury. It is a visual representation of its 700hp supercharged V8 engine—muscular and dominant, yet refined and controlled. Every line and surface is intentional, communicating performance capability and technological prowess.

## 3. Key Exterior Design Elements

*   **Stance & Proportions:**
    *   **Wide and Planted:** The track width is significantly wider than a standard Escalade, giving the truck an imposing, unshakable presence.
    *   **High Beltline:** A high, straight shoulder line runs the length of the vehicle, creating a sense of fortress-like security and strength.
    *   **Fast Windshield Angle:** A more aggressively raked windshield than traditional trucks, adding to the sporting character.

*   **Front Fascia:**
    *   **Dominant Grille:** A large, intricate black mesh grille with a prominent, monochromatic Cadillac crest. The grille is framed by a thick, body-color surround.
    *   **Vertical Lighting:** Signature Cadillac vertical LED daytime running lights are pushed to the outer edges of the fascia, accentuating the truck's width. The primary headlights are slim, horizontal units seamlessly integrated below the DRLs.
    *   **Vented Hood:** A functional, heat-extracting hood with aggressive vents, signaling the supercharged power underneath.

*   **Body & Surfacing:**
    *   **Crisp, Taut Lines:** The body sides are characterized by sharp, architectural lines rather than soft, organic curves. This creates a faceted, modern look.
    *   **Flared Fenders:** Pronounced, squared-off fender flares are required to house the large, off-road capable tires. They are a primary visual signifier of the truck's performance.
    *   **Integrated Running Boards:** Sleek, body-integrated running boards that deploy electronically.

*   **Rear Fascia:**
    *   **Full-Width Taillight:** A slim, full-width LED taillight bar with the Cadillac script subtly integrated.
    *   **Quad Exhaust:** Large-diameter, black-tipped quad exhaust finishers, cleanly integrated into the rear bumper.
    *   **V-Series Branding:** A prominent "V" badge on the tailgate.

## 4. Color, Materials & Finish (CMF)

*   **Hero Color:**
    *   **"Velocity Yellow":** A vibrant, highly saturated yellow with a pearlescent finish. This color is bold and confident, perfectly matching the truck's character. It will be the primary color used in all launch marketing materials.

*   **Accent Finishes:**
    *   **Gloss Black:** All trim, badging, grille, and mirror caps are to be finished in high-gloss black. There is no chrome on the vehicle.
    *   **Carbon Fiber:** Optional packages will include exposed carbon fiber on the hood vent, mirror caps, and interior trim.

*   **Wheels:**
    *   **Standard:** 22-inch forged aluminum wheels in a complex, multi-spoke design, finished in gloss black.
    *   **Optional:** 24-inch wheels with a similar design.

## 5. Interior Design Direction

*   **Cockpit Environment:** The interior should feel like the cockpit of a fighter jet—driver-focused, technologically advanced, and luxurious.
*   **38-Inch OLED:** The curved OLED display is the centerpiece. The user interface will feature custom V-Series performance themes with a yellow accent color to match the exterior.
*   **Seating:** Heavily bolstered performance seats with heating, ventilation, and massage functions. They will feature yellow contrast stitching and perforated leather inserts.
*   **Materials:** A mix of semi-aniline leather, Alcantara, and real carbon fiber trim.
