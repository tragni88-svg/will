### Phase Transition

With all suppliers and costs locked in, the "Source" phase is complete.

We now officially transition to the **"Pack" Phase**. This next chapter will focus on the construction of our Gigafactory network and the establishment of the automated assembly lines that will bring the RRM-1 to life.
