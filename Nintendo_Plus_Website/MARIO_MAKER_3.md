# Mario Maker 3 - Game Design Document

## 1. Logline

The ultimate Mario level creation tool returns, now with a third dimension. For the first time ever, build, share, and play not only classic 2D Mario levels but also full 3D courses in the style of *Super Mario 64* and *Super Mario Odyssey*.

## 2. Core Gameplay Innovations

*   **3D World-Builder:**
    *   A brand new, intuitive editor for creating 3D levels. Players can sculpt terrain, place platforms, set camera angles, and design complex vertical structures.
    *   Two 3D styles are available at launch: **"64-Bit"** (emulating the blocky, colorful aesthetic of *Super Mario 64*) and **"Odyssey"** (using the modern, high-fidelity assets of *Super Mario Odyssey*).
*   **Super Worlds 2.0:**
    *   Your Super Worlds are no longer just a linear path of levels. You can now create fully explorable 3D overworlds, complete with secret exits, hidden Toad Houses, and branching paths, just like in *Super Mario World* or *Super Mario 64*'s castle grounds.
*   **New Course Theme: "Haunted Forest"**
    *   A spooky, fog-filled forest theme available in all game styles. Features new enemies like Ghost Goombas and Scaredy-Shrooms, and introduces a new "fog" gizmo that can obscure parts of the level.
*   **Multiplayer Maker:**
    *   A cooperative creation mode where two players can build a level together online in real-time. See your friend's cursor as you place blocks, enemies, and power-ups simultaneously.

## 3. New Power-Ups & Tools

*   **The "Dimension Door" (3D Editor Only):** Place a door that instantly teleports Mario to another location in your 3D level, allowing for complex, non-linear designs.
*   **The "Mega Mushroom" (2D Styles):** The classic power-up from *New Super Mario Bros.* returns, allowing Mario to grow to a massive size and smash through the level.
*   **Enemy Pathing Tool:** You can now draw a precise path for any enemy to follow, allowing for more complex and predictable enemy patterns.

## 4. Narrative (Story Mode)

Bowser has kidnapped not just Princess Peach, but also the lead designer of the Mario Maker course-bot, Undodog! Mario must play through 100+ new, professionally designed levels created by the Nintendo team to rescue them. This mode serves as a showcase for the new 3D building tools and provides inspiration for players.
