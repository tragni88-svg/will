# Super Mario Tactics - Game Design Document

## 1. Logline

Mario meets turn-based strategy. In this fresh take on the Mushroom Kingdom, lead a team of iconic heroes through grid-based tactical battles to stop Bowser's most calculated invasion yet.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Grid-Based Combat:** Command a squad of 3-5 characters on a grid-based battlefield. Each character has a unique set of abilities, movement ranges, and attack styles.
*   **Environmental Tactics:** The environment is a key part of your strategy. Use Warp Pipes to flank enemies, knock foes into Piranha Plants, and use POW Blocks to trigger earthquakes that stun everyone in an area.
*   **Team Composition:**
    *   Build your squad from a roster of beloved characters. Mario is a balanced Brawler, Luigi is a high-jumping Archer with his Poltergust, Peach is a powerful Healer and Support unit, and Toad is a fast-moving Rogue who can disable traps.
    *   Unlock more characters as you progress, including Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and even some reformed enemies like a friendly Goomba.
*   **No RNG:** This is a game of pure strategy, not luck. All damage numbers are fixed and predictable. If you have the right position and the right plan, success is guaranteed. There are no random critical hits or miss chances.

## 3. Progression & Customization

*   **Skill Trees:** As your heroes level up, you can unlock new abilities and passive buffs in their unique skill trees. Will you build Mario to be a single-target powerhouse or a master of area-of-effect ground pounds?
*   **The Hub World: Peach's Castle:** Between missions, you return to Peach's Castle. Here you can talk to your teammates, upgrade your gear at Toadette's Workshop, and practice new strategies in the castle gardens.

## 4. Narrative

Bowser, tired of his usual plans failing, has enlisted the help of Kamek, who has created an army of highly disciplined, tactically brilliant Koopa Troopas. They aren't just charging in; they are setting up ambushes, fortifying positions, and cutting off supply lines. Mario must assemble his own elite team to out-think and out-maneuver Bowser's new army in a kingdom-wide game of chess.
