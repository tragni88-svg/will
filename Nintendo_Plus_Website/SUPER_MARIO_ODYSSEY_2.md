## 1. Logline

Mario and Cappy return for a globe-trotting, hat-tossing adventure that takes them beyond the confines of a single world. This time, they will journey through parallel dimensions, capturing entirely new sets of enemies and objects to solve multi-dimensional puzzles and stop a new, reality-bending threat.

## 2. Core Gameplay Innovations

*   **Dimensional Rifts:** The central mechanic. At specific points, Mario can throw Cappy at a "Dimensional Rift" to open a portal to an alternate version of the current Kingdom. This alternate reality might have different gravity, altered layouts, unique enemies, and new Power Moons to collect.
*   **Expanded Capture Abilities:**
    *   **Dual Captures:** Capture two smaller enemies simultaneously to combine their abilities. (e.g., Capture a Bullet Bill and a Paragoomba to create a flying, explosive projectile that you control).
    *   **Environmental Captures:** Capture large-scale environmental features, like a chunk of a moving platform to steer it, or a gust of wind to redirect it.
*   **The Odyssey 2.0:** The Odyssey ship is now a customizable hub world. Players can decorate the interior with souvenirs from different Kingdoms and unlock new rooms, including a training area to practice complex moves.

## 3. New Kingdoms

*   **The Clockwork City:** A sprawling metropolis made of brass and gears, where entire buildings shift and reconfigure on a timer. The dimensional rift reveals a frozen, rusted version of the city where time has stopped.
*   **The Whispering Mangroves:** A dense, mystical swamp where ancient trees have sentient faces. The alternate dimension is a vibrant, bioluminescent version of the swamp, teeming with magical creatures.
*   **The Crystal Spire:** A towering mountain of pure crystal that refracts light into deadly energy beams. The rift leads to a shattered, dark-crystal version where light is absorbed, creating puzzles based on shadow and darkness.

## 4. Narrative

Bowser has accidentally shattered the "Dimension Gem," a powerful artifact that kept the multiverse stable. Now, rifts are opening everywhere, and a mysterious, shadowy version of Mario—**"Enigma Mario"**—is using the chaos to drain energy from every dimension. Mario and Cappy must team up with new allies, including a dimension-hopping historian named Professor Phileas, to restore the Gem and stop Enigma Mario before all realities collapse.
