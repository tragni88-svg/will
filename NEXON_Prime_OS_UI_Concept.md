# NEXON Prime: OS & UI Concept

## 1. Operating System: PrimeOS

*   **Name:** PrimeOS
*   **Core Architecture:** Custom, lightweight kernel based on FreeBSD. Highly optimized for gaming and low-level hardware access.
*   **Design Philosophy:** "Velocity." Every aspect of the OS is engineered for speed, from a sub-5-second boot time to instantaneous UI transitions. The OS reserves a minimal memory footprint, ensuring maximum system resources are always available for games.

## 2. User Interface (UI): The "Prime Meridian"

The UI, named the Prime Meridian, is a minimalist, content-forward interface designed to get players into their games as quickly as possible.

*   **Home Screen:**
    *   **Layout:** A single, horizontally-scrolling row of game and app icons. The most recently used title is the largest and is positioned at the center of the screen.
    *   **Dynamic Background:** The background is a dynamic, blurred image or video from the currently selected game, creating an immersive and constantly changing visual theme.
    *   **No Vertical Clutter:** The home screen is intentionally clean. There are no folders or complex grids. All secondary functions are accessed via a single, unobtrusive overlay.

*   **The Command Bar (Overlay):**
    *   **Activation:** A single press of the "NEXON" button on the controller instantly brings up the Command Bar at the bottom of the screen, overlaying the current game or app.
    *   **Functionality:** The Command Bar provides access to all essential system features without leaving the game:
        *   **Profile:** Manage your account, status, and friends.
        *   **Parties:** Create and manage voice chat parties.
        *   **Store:** A quick-access portal to the NEXON game store.
        *   **Library:** Your full game and app library.
        *   **Settings:** System and controller settings.
        *   **Power:** Rest mode, power off, restart.
    *   **Contextual Cards:** When in a game, the Command Bar will also display contextual "Activity Cards," similar to the PS5. These cards allow players to jump directly into specific game modes, join friends' sessions, or track trophy/achievement progress.

## 3. Key Features & Ecosystem Integration

*   **NEXON Store:**
    *   A clean, fast, and easy-to-navigate digital storefront. Game pages feature high-resolution art, 4K trailers, and clear performance metrics (e.g., "Optimized for 8K," "Ray Tracing Enabled").
    *   The store will be the exclusive console home for *Counter-Strike 3*.

*   **Instant Resume:**
    *   Leveraging the PCIe 5.0 SSD, PrimeOS can hold up to 5 games in a suspended state. Players can switch between these games in under 3 seconds, picking up exactly where they left off.

*   **NEXON Social:**
    *   A fully integrated social layer. Create parties, share screenshots and 60-second 8K video clips, and stream directly to major platforms with dedicated hardware encoding.

*   **Backward Compatibility:**
    *   The OS includes a hypervisor-level emulation layer for select last-generation titles, with performance enhancements (e.g., resolution boosts, more stable frame rates) enabled by the Prime's superior hardware.
