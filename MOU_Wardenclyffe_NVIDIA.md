# Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

**Between:**

The Wardenclyffe Initiative, hereafter referred to as "THE INITIATIVE"

**And:**

NVIDIA Corporation, hereafter referred to as "THE PARTNER"

**Effective Date:** January 27, 2026

--- 

### **Subject: Strategic Partnership for the Design, Fabrication, and Supply of the Wardenclyffe Sync-Chip, Mark I (WSC-1)**

--- 

### 1. Purpose & Scope

This Memorandum of Understanding establishes an exclusive strategic partnership between THE INITIATIVE and THE PARTNER for the design, fabrication, and high-volume supply of a custom System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designated as the WSC-1. This component will serve as the AI-powered control unit for the Wardenclyffe Initiative's residential receiver modules.

### 2. Terms of Agreement

Based on the proposal submitted by THE PARTNER in response to RFQ-CSC-01, both parties agree to the following terms:

*   **Technology Platform:** THE PARTNER will develop the WSC-1 based on a custom implementation of its "Ada Lovelace" architecture, featuring a dedicated **Tensor Core NPU** for advanced AI/ML processing.

*   **Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) Costs:** THE INITIATIVE agrees to fund the NRE costs for the design, tape-out, and validation of the WSC-1, in the amount of **$450,000,000 USD**.

*   **Production Volume & Pricing:** THE PARTNER agrees to supply a total of **140,000,000 (one hundred forty million)** units of the WSC-1. The unit price is set at **$28.00 USD** for annual volumes of 25,000,000 or more.

*   **Total Contract Value:** The total estimated value of this agreement (NRE and production units) is **$4,370,000,000 USD**.

### 3. Mutual Commitments

*   **THE INITIATIVE** commits to providing the NRE funding on an agreed-upon schedule and to issue binding purchase orders for the full production volume.

*   **THE PARTNER** commits to meeting the performance specifications, quality standards, and delivery timelines as outlined in their proposal. They will provide dedicated engineering support and transparent progress reports throughout the design and fabrication process.

### 4. Intellectual Property

THE PARTNER will retain ownership of its underlying chip architecture and Tensor Core IP. THE INITIATIVE will own the specific AI models and firmware developed for the WSC-1.
