# Final Supplier Proposal Comparison: FAE-01 & HMT-01

**Project:** Wardenclyffe Initiative - Final Component Sourcing
**Objective:** To select the optimal partners for Antenna Etching and Housing Manufacturing.

### Part 1: RFQ-FAE-01 - Fractal Antenna Etching

**Summary:** Both Foxconn and Jabil are world-class electronics manufacturers and can easily meet our technical requirements. The decision comes down to cost and their proposed integration with our supply chain.

*   **Proposal 1: Foxconn Technology Group**
    *   **Unit Price (Etching Process):** **$8.50**
    *   **Total Project Cost (Etching):** **$1.19 Billion**
    *   **Proposal:** Foxconn proposes to handle the etching process at a new facility co-located with our planned Gigafactory Texas. They offer a seamless, just-in-time logistics solution.

*   **Proposal 2: Jabil Inc.**
    *   **Unit Price (Etching Process):** **$9.00**
    *   **Total Project Cost (Etching):** **$1.26 Billion**
    *   **Proposal:** Jabil offers a robust plan to perform the etching at their existing facilities in Mexico and then ship the completed substrates to our Gigafactories.

**Recommendation (Antenna Etching):**
I recommend we select **Foxconn**. Their lower unit price and their proposal to co-locate their facility with our Gigafactory offers superior logistical efficiency and cost savings.

### Part 2: RFQ-HMT-01 - Polymer Housing

**Summary:** Both DuPont and BASF are global leaders in polymer science and can provide a housing that meets our specifications. The choice is between a premium material and a highly cost-effective, standard solution.

*   **Proposal 1: DuPont de Nemours, Inc.**
    *   **Unit Price (Housing):** **$12.00**
    *   **Total Project Cost (Housing):** **$1.68 Billion**
    *   **Proposal:** DuPont proposes using a proprietary, high-performance polymer blend that offers superior durability and a premium finish. The cost reflects the premium nature of the material.

*   **Proposal 2: BASF SE**
    *   **Unit Price (Housing):** **$9.50**
    *   **Total Project Cost (Housing):** **$1.33 Billion**
    *   **Proposal:** BASF offers a high-quality, industry-standard polymer that meets all of our specifications (including the UL94-V0 flame rating) at a very competitive price point.

**Recommendation (Housing):**
I recommend we select **BASF**. While the DuPont material is excellent, the BASF polymer meets all of our requirements at a significantly lower cost, saving the project over $350 million. For a component like the housing, cost-effectiveness is the priority.
