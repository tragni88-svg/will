# Helios Pistol: H-P1 "Justicar"

## 1. Overview

The Justicar is a compact, semi-automatic sidearm utilizing the new **Photonic-Kinetic Hybrid (PKH)** technology. It is designed for close-quarters combat and as a backup weapon for soldiers carrying heavier Helios variants. It prioritizes speed and stopping power, delivering a "laser bullet" that hits harder than a .45 ACP.

## 2. Specifications

*   **Designation:** H-P1 (Helios-Pistol, Model 1)
*   **Nickname:** "Justicar"
*   **Power Source:** 1 x Compact Fusion Cell (CFC)
*   **Optimal Range:** 2 - 50 meters
*   **Fire Modes:** Semi-Automatic
*   **Sighting System:** Integrated iron sights with tritium inserts for low-light visibility.

## 3. Key Features

*   **Smart Grip:** The grip contains sensors that detect when the weapon is being held. To save power, the weapon enters a low-power sleep mode when not in hand and instantly powers up when gripped.
*   **Quick-Eject System:** The CFC is located in the pistol grip, similar to a traditional magazine. A button on the side of the grip allows for a rapid, one-handed ejection and replacement of the power cell.
*   **Minimalist Design:** The Justicar has no external rails or modular attachment points, keeping it sleek and preventing it from snagging on clothing or gear.
*   **Enhanced Lethality:** The PKH rounds create a wound channel significantly larger than the projectile itself due to thermal expansion, ensuring targets are neutralized with fewer shots.
