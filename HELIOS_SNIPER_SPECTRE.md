# Helios Sniper: H-S1 "Spectre"

## 1. Overview

The Spectre is a high-precision, bolt-action sniper rifle. It is designed for extreme long-range engagements and is the most powerful weapon in the Helios family. Each shot requires a massive amount of energy, which is manually charged by the operator. The PKH round fired by the Spectre is essentially a railgun slug made of solid light.

## 2. Specifications

*   **Designation:** H-S1 (Helios-Sniper, Model 1)
*   **Nickname:** "Spectre"
*   **Power Source:** 1 x Compact Fusion Cell (CFC)
*   **Optimal Range:** 800 - 2,500 meters
*   **Fire Modes:** Bolt-Action (Single Shot)
*   **Sighting System:** Comes standard with a 12-48x variable zoom smart scope. The scope is digitally linked to the weapon and displays battery, heat, windage, and even the curvature of the planet for extreme-range shots.

## 3. Key Features

*   **Capacitor Charging System:** This is the "bolt-action" of the laser sniper. After each shot, the operator must pull back a charging handle. This action disconnects the primary capacitor from the heat sink and connects it to the CFC, charging it for the next shot. This process takes approximately 1.5 seconds and produces a faint, high-tech whining sound.
*   **Overcharge Shot:** The operator can hold the charging handle back for an extended period (up to 5 seconds) to "overcharge" the capacitor. This creates a single, devastatingly powerful PKH shot that hits with the force of an anti-materiel rifle, capable of penetrating light tank armor and concrete bunkers.
*   **Bipod & Stabilizer:** The Spectre comes with an integrated, adjustable bipod. The stock also contains a gyroscopic stabilizer that helps to mitigate minor movements from the operator's breathing, ensuring maximum accuracy.
*   **Mass-Driver Ballistics:** At 2,500 meters, the PKH round retains 99% of its kinetic energy, ensuring that a hit at maximum range is just as lethal as a point-blank shot.
