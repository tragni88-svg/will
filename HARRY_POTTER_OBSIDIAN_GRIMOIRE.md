# Harry Potter: The Obsidian Grimoire - Game Design Document

## 1. Logline

Return to Hogwarts as a new student in a post-Voldemort wizarding world. When a forbidden, ink-black grimoire is discovered in the castle's depths, you are drawn into a dangerous mystery that will force you to master powerful new magic, forge alliances, and confront a shadowy cabal that seeks to harness the book's dark power.

## 2. Core Gameplay

*   **Genre:** Single-Player, Action-RPG
*   **Platform:** Steam (PC), optimized for high-end systems.
*   **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5, enhanced with the **Chroma-Quill Engine**.

### a. Character Creation & Progression

*   Create your own witch or wizard. Choose your appearance, your wand (wood, core, flexibility), and your starting magical aptitude (e.g., a natural talent for Charms, a knack for Potions).
*   You are a new student, sorted into one of the four Hogwarts houses. Your choice of house will affect your common room, your relationships with certain characters, and will open up unique side quests.
*   Attend classes like Charms, Potions, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. These are not just cutscenes; they are interactive mini-games where you learn new spells and techniques.

### b. The Spellcasting System

*   **Dynamic & Expressive:** Spellcasting is not just a button press. On a controller, you will use the analog sticks to trace a spell's motion. On a keyboard, you will use mouse gestures.
*   **The Power of Intent:** The effectiveness of your spell is determined by your timing and precision. A perfectly cast *Incendio* will be a powerful jet of flame, while a sloppy one will be a mere puff of smoke.
*   **Chroma-Quill Integration:** The color and intensity of your spells are a direct reflection of your skill. As you become a more powerful wizard, your spells will become visibly more brilliant and complex.

### c. The Central Mystery: The Obsidian Grimoire

*   The main story revolves around a mysterious, powerful book that seems to write itself, its ink-black pages revealing new spells and dark secrets as you complete quests.
*   The Grimoire allows you to learn **"Ink-Magic,"** a forgotten branch of magic that allows you to manipulate shadows and illusions. This is where the Chroma-Quill Engine truly shines, as you will use Aether-light spells to reveal the Grimoire's hidden text.

## 3. The World

*   **A Living Hogwarts:** Explore a breathtakingly detailed and fully interactive Hogwarts castle, rendered in stunning 10K with the Chroma-Quill Engine. The castle is filled with secrets, hidden passages, and students going about their daily lives.
*   **Beyond the Castle:** The game will also take you to familiar locations like Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, as well as entirely new, never-before-seen corners of the wizarding world.

## 4. Narrative Synopsis

The game begins with your arrival at Hogwarts. During a late-night exploration, you stumble upon a hidden chamber and discover the Obsidian Grimoire. The book binds itself to you, and you soon learn that a secret society, known as the **"Scribes of Dusk,"** is hunting for it. They believe the Grimoire holds the key to achieving a dark form of immortality. You must learn to master the Grimoire's power, uncover the Scribes' plot, and make choices that will determine the fate of the wizarding world.
