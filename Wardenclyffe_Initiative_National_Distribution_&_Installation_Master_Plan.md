**Document Version:** 1.0

**Author:** Gemini

## 1.0 Executive Summary

The "Ship" phase represents the culmination of the Wardenclyffe Initiative: the physical delivery and installation of 140 million Residential Receiver Modules (RRM-1) to households across the United States. This document outlines the master plan for this monumental undertaking, covering national logistics, a tiered distribution network, a certified installer program, and a phased, geographically-based rollout. Our mission is to ensure a seamless, efficient, and positive experience for every American household transitioning to wireless power.

## 2.0 Core Strategic Pillars

This plan is built on four strategic pillars:

1.  **Strategic Logistics Partnerships:** Leveraging the scale and expertise of national logistics leaders to manage the transportation of millions of units.
2.  **Hub-and-Spoke Distribution Network:** A multi-tiered network of distribution centers to ensure efficient inventory management and rapid last-mile delivery.
3.  **Certified Installer Ecosystem:** Creating a large, highly-trained, and certified network of third-party electrical contractors to perform safe and standardized in-home installations.
4.  **Phased Regional Rollout:** A data-driven, geographically staged deployment that aligns with Gigafactory production output and logistical capacity.

## 3.0 Logistics & Distribution Network

### 3.1 Primary Logistics Partner

*   **Action:** Issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to select a primary logistics partner (e.g., FedEx Logistics, UPS Supply Chain Solutions, Ryder System) to manage all freight movements from the four Gigafactories.
*   **Scope:** The partner will be responsible for truckload (TL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments from TX, OH, NV, and SC to our regional distribution hubs.

### 3.2 Hub-and-Spoke Model

*   **Tier 1: Regional Super Hubs (4):**
    *   **Location:** Co-located or adjacent to each of the four Gigafactories.
    *   **Function:** Receive the entire output of the factory. Act as the primary inventory buffer and sorting center for multi-state regions.
*   **Tier 2: Metropolitan Distribution Centers (MDCs) (~50):**
    *   **Location:** Situated on the outskirts of the top 50-75 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).
    *   **Function:** Receive bulk shipments from the Regional Super Hubs. Stage inventory for last-mile delivery to local installers.
*   **Tier 3: Local Installer Inventory:**
    *   **Function:** Certified installation partners will maintain a small, just-in-time inventory of RRM-1 units, replenished from their local MDC.

## 4.0 Certified Installer Program: "Wardenclyffe Guild"

A certified, professional installation is mandatory for the RRM-1. We will create a nationwide network of trusted partners.

*   **Program Name:** The Wardenclyffe Guild
*   **Recruitment:** Target existing licensed electrical contracting businesses, from small local shops to large regional firms.
*   **Certification Process:**
    1.  **Online Training:** A comprehensive online curriculum covering the physics of resonant inductive coupling, RRM-1 technical specifications, and installation best practices.
    2.  **Hands-On Workshop:** A one-day, in-person workshop at regional training centers for practical installation experience.
    3.  **Background Check & Insurance Verification:** Ensuring the highest standards of professionalism and safety.
*   **Incentives:** Guild members will receive a steady stream of installation jobs, preferred rates on business insurance, and access to co-branded marketing materials.

## 5.0 Phased National Rollout Plan

The rollout will be executed in five geographical phases, starting with the regions closest to our initial Gigafactory in Texas.

*   **Phase 1 (Year 3, Q3): The Southwest**
    *   **States:** Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico
    *   **Source Factory:** Texas
*   **Phase 2 (Year 3, Q4): The Midwest**
    *   **States:** Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania
    *   **Source Factory:** Ohio
*   **Phase 3 (Year 4, Q1): The West Coast**
    *   **States:** Nevada, California, Arizona, Oregon, Washington
    *   **Source Factory:** Nevada
*   **Phase 4 (Year 4, Q2): The Southeast**
    *   **States:** South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Alabama
    *   **Source Factory:** South Carolina
*   **Phase 5 (Year 4, Q3-Q4): The Mountain West & Northeast**
    *   **States:** All remaining contiguous states.
    *   **Source Factories:** All four factories will supply these regions as the network reaches full capacity.

## 6.0 Customer Experience & Scheduling

*   **Action:** Develop a national web portal and mobile app.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Homeowners can enter their address to see when the rollout is scheduled for their area.
    *   Once available, they can select a certified "Wardenclyffe Guild" installer from a list of local options.
    *   Schedule their installation appointment directly through the portal.

This master plan provides the framework for the successful execution of the "Ship" phase.
