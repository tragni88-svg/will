# Helios Vehicle-Mounted Cannon: H-V2 "Glaive"

## 1. Overview

The H-V2 "Glaive" is a heavy, rapid-fire, vehicle-mounted directed-energy weapon. It takes the core principles of the Helios system and scales them up for armored warfare, serving as both an anti-infantry and anti-vehicle platform.

## 2. Specifications

*   **Designation:** H-V2 (Helios-Vehicle, Model 2)
*   **Nickname:** "Glaive"
*   **Power Source:** Direct integration with the vehicle's power core (typically a larger fusion or advanced electric generator). It does not use portable CFCs.
*   **Optimal Range:** 100 - 4,000 meters
*   **Fire Modes:** Fully-Automatic, Target-Lock Burst
*   **Rate of Fire (Full Auto):** 450 RPM (A lower RPM than the rifle, but each pulse is significantly more powerful).

## 3. Key Features

*   **Twin-Crystal Assembly:** The Glaive uses two parallel laser-generating crystals that fire in a rapid alternating sequence. This allows one crystal to be in a micro-second cooling cycle while the other fires, enabling sustained, high-power output without immediate overheating.
*   **Liquid Cooling System:** Unlike the portable Cryo-Capacitor, the Glaive is liquid-cooled, circulating a specialized coolant through the weapon assembly and back to a radiator unit on the vehicle's chassis. This provides vastly superior heat management for prolonged engagements.
*   **Target-Lock Burst Mode:** The weapon's advanced targeting software can lock onto a designated enemy vehicle. Once locked, the Glaive fires a concentrated, 10-round burst at the target's weakest point, identified by the system's scanner. This mode requires a 3-second lock-on period.
*   **EMP Hardening:** The entire weapon system is electromagnetically hardened, protecting its sensitive electronics from EMP attacks that would disable other advanced weapon systems.

## 4. Common Vehicle Mounts

The Glaive is typically mounted on:
*   **Main Battle Tanks:** As a coaxial weapon alongside the main cannon, used for engaging light vehicles and infantry.
*   **Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs):** As the primary weapon system on a remote-controlled turret.
*   **Attack Helicopters:** As a chin-mounted cannon for air-to-ground support.
