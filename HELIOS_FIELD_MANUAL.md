# Helios Weapon System - Field Manual TM-HWS-001

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1-1. OVERVIEW
This manual provides instruction for the operation and maintenance of the Helios Weapon System (HWS). The HWS represents a fundamental shift in infantry combat, replacing conventional chemical propellants with advanced directed-energy technology. Adherence to these procedures is mandatory for all personnel.

### 1-2. SAFETY WARNINGS
*   DO NOT point a Helios weapon at any personnel, friendly or otherwise, unless you intend to engage.
*   DO NOT attempt to disassemble the Compact Fusion Cell (CFC). A breached cell is a dead cell. There is no risk of explosion, but the unit will be rendered permanently inoperable.
*   The laser is invisible. Confirm your target and what is beyond it. The beam will continue until it impacts a non-transmissive surface.
*   An Emergency Heat Purge creates a visible distortion wave. This action will compromise your position. Use only in critical situations.

## CHAPTER 2: OPERATION

### 2-1. LOADING AND UNLOADING
1.  **Loading:** Secure a fully charged CFC. On the H-R1 and H-S1, slide the cell into the forward housing until it clicks. On the H-P1, insert the cell into the pistol grip like a standard magazine.
2.  **Confirmation:** The weapon's indicator light will shift from red to green, and the holographic sight (on the H-R1/H-S1) will activate.
3.  **Unloading:** Depress the release stud and remove the CFC. Store in a designated pouch.

### 2-2. ENGAGING TARGETS
1.  Acquire a sight picture.
2.  Disengage the safety.
3.  Squeeze the trigger to discharge a laser pulse. For the H-S1, pull the charging handle to load the capacitor before firing.
4.  Note the heat level on your HUD or sight. If the heat gauge flashes red, cease fire and allow the weapon to cool via passive venting.

## CHAPTER 3: FIELD MAINTENANCE

### 3-1. DAILY PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE
1.  **Optics Cleaning:** The primary lens of the laser emitter is the most critical component. Use the issued microfiber cloth to clean it of all dust, dirt, and moisture. A dirty lens will disperse the beam and dramatically reduce effective range.
2.  **CFC Terminal Wipe:** Remove the CFC and wipe the metal contacts on both the cell and the weapon housing to ensure a clean energy transfer.
3.  **Heat Sink Inspection:** Visually inspect the heat sink vents for any obstructions (mud, foliage, etc.). Clear any debris.

### 3-2. RECHARGING THE CFC
1.  Connect the CFC to a standard power station or a portable solar blanket.
2.  The indicator light on the CFC will blink during charging and turn solid green when fully charged.
3.  A full charge takes approximately 30 minutes at a station or 4 hours via solar.
