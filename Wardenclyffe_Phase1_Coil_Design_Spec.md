# Wardenclyffe Initiative - Phase 1 Coil Design Specifications

**Document Purpose:** To define the initial conceptual design and target specifications for the prototype transmitter and receiver coils for the Phase 1 Feasibility Study.

### 1. Transmitter: The "Wardenclyffe Mark I" Tower

This is a large-scale, stationary resonant transmitter designed for maximum power broadcast in a controlled test environment.

*   **Designation:** Wardenclyffe Transmitter, Mark I (WT-1)
*   **Scale:** 150-meter tall, self-supporting lattice structure.
*   **Topload:** 30-meter diameter toroidal capacitor, constructed from polished aluminum and internally pressurized with inert gas.
*   **Primary Coil:** 10 turns of 10cm diameter, cryo-cooled superconducting cable (Niobium-Titanium alloy) at the base of the tower.
*   **Secondary Coil:** 800-1000 turns of 5cm diameter copper litz wire, wound on a 100-meter tall cylindrical fiberglass former.
*   **Operating Frequency:** Tuned to a precise frequency in the Very Low Frequency (VLF) band (e.g., 60 kHz), chosen for its favorable atmospheric propagation characteristics.
*   **Power Input:** Designed to handle up to 10 Megawatts of input power from a dedicated substation.
*   **Control System:** AI-driven frequency and impedance matching system to maintain resonance with the Earth-ionosphere cavity and the network of receivers.

### 2. Receiver: The Resonant Receiver Module (RRM-1)

This is the compact, mass-producible unit designed for installation in homes and businesses.

*   **Designation:** Resonant Receiver Module, Model 1 (RRM-1)
*   **Form Factor:** A sleek, 45cm x 45cm x 10cm wall-mountable panel.
*   **Antenna:** A fractal-patterned resonant antenna etched onto a metamaterial substrate. This design maximizes energy capture in a small footprint.
*   **Internal Components:**
    *   **Tuning Circuit:** Automatically synchronizes with the WT-1's broadcast frequency.
    *   **Rectifier & Inverter:** Converts the captured high-frequency AC energy into standard 60 Hz household AC power (120V/240V).
    *   **Safety Cutoff:** A fail-safe mechanism that de-energizes the unit if it detects any internal fault or external tampering.
*   **Power Output:** The prototype RRM-1 is designed to deliver a continuous 15 kilowatts, sufficient to power a standard American home.
*   **Efficiency Target:** The primary goal of Phase 1 is to achieve an end-to-end (transmitter-to-receiver) efficiency of over 85% within a 10km radius of the WT-1 prototype.

**Conclusion:** These specifications represent the ambitious starting point for our Phase 1 research. The successful development and testing of the WT-1 and RRM-1 prototypes will be the first concrete validation of the Wardenclyffe Initiative.
