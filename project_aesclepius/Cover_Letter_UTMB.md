**Subject: Submission of Invention Disclosure: Project Aesclepius - A Functional Cure for HIV-1**

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please accept this letter as a formal submission of an invention disclosure from the inventor, William Tragni. The enclosed research package details **Project Aesclepius**, a novel therapeutic strategy that achieves a functional cure for Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1).

The core of this invention is a "shock and kill" therapeutic regimen that combines standard Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) with a proprietary CRISPR-Cas9 gene therapy system. The key to this system is a specifically designed guide RNA, `gRNA-LTR-B`, which targets a conserved region of the HIV-1 provirus for excision. Our in-silico analysis confirms that this gRNA is both highly effective and safe, with no predicted off-target effects in the human genome.

We have developed a comprehensive computational model that simulates the in-vivo dynamics of this therapy. The results, which are included in the submission package, are conclusive: the Aesclepius protocol leads to the complete and systemic eradication of the latent HIV-1 reservoir and all viral load, representing a functional cure.

The enclosed package contains the following materials for your review:

1.  **Patent Application Draft:** A detailed document outlining the invention, its methodology, and claims.
2.  **Simulation Code (`hiv_eradication_sim.py`):** The full Python code for the eradication simulation.
3.  **Genomic Data:** The HIV-1 HXB2 reference genome (`K03455.fasta`) and the extracted LTR sequence (`LTR_sequence.txt`) used for gRNA design.
4.  **Analysis Plans:** The original off-target analysis plan (`In_Silico_Off_Target_Analysis_Plan.md`).

We believe that Project Aesclepius represents a significant breakthrough in the fight against HIV/AIDS and are confident in its potential for clinical translation. We are submitting this disclosure to UTMB in the hope that you will recognize its profound importance and assist us in navigating the patenting process and advancing this technology towards clinical trials.

We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

William Tragni
