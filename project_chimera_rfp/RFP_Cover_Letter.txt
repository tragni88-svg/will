Dear Mr. Calhoun,

This letter serves as a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of a revolutionary new vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle, designated Project Chimera.

The Chimera vehicle utilizes a proprietary Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drive for silent, efficient, and highly maneuverable flight. All core systems have been validated through extensive high-fidelity simulations, confirming the design's stability and performance.

Attached to this communication is the complete Technical Data Package (TDP) for Project Chimera, including:
- Executive Summary
- Detailed Technical Specifications
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Manufacturing and Assembly Plan

The TDP contains all necessary information for your engineering teams to conduct a thorough review and submit a comprehensive production proposal. We are seeking a strategic partner to fabricate, assemble, and integrate the first full-scale prototype.

We believe Boeing's extensive experience in advanced aerospace manufacturing makes you an ideal partner for this groundbreaking project. We anticipate your proposal within 60 days of this notice.

Sincerely,

Chief Defense & Aerospace Architect
Project Chimera
