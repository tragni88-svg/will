# Project Chimera: Manufacturing and Assembly Plan

## 1.0 Overview
This document details the phased manufacturing and assembly plan for the first Project Chimera prototype. The plan is designed to ensure quality control and systematic integration of all critical subsystems.

## 2.0 Phase 1: Airframe Fabrication
- **Objective:** Construct the primary vehicle structure.
- **Steps:**
  1. Fabricate the lower and upper fuselage sections using carbon-fiber composite layups in large-scale molds.
  2. Machine the titanium alloy substructure components, including the reactor housing and MHD segment mounts.
  3. Bond the titanium substructure into the lower fuselage section.
  4. Integrate the retractable landing gear assemblies into the lower fuselage.

## 3.0 Phase 2: Subsystem Pre-Integration
- **Objective:** Assemble and test major subsystems before installation into the airframe.
- **Steps:**
  1. **MHD Propulsion Units:** Assemble each of the 8 MHD segments. This includes winding the YBCO superconducting magnets, integrating the cryocoolers, and installing the plasma ionization emitters.
  2. **Power System:** Assemble the compact nuclear reactor, shielding, and the Brayton cycle turbine into a single, integrated power block. This will be done in a specialized facility.
  3. **Avionics Rack:** Integrate the flight computers, navigation systems, and sensor data processors into a single, shock-mounted avionics rack.

## 4.0 Phase 3: Final Assembly and Integration
- **Objective:** Install all subsystems into the airframe and complete the vehicle.
- **Steps:**
  1. Lower the integrated power block into the central housing of the lower fuselage.
  2. Install the 8 pre-integrated MHD propulsion segments into their respective mounts.
  3. Connect the superconducting power busbars from the power block to the MHD segments.
  4. Install the primary avionics rack and connect all data and power harnesses.
  5. Mate the upper fuselage section to the lower fuselage, sealing the primary structure.

## 5.0 Phase 4: Systems Verification and Ground Testing
- **Objective:** Verify all systems are functioning correctly before first flight.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Power-On Test:** Bring the reactor to criticality and test the electrical output of the Brayton turbine.
  2. **MHD System Test:** Cool the magnets to superconducting temperatures and perform a low-power static test of each MHD segment to verify plasma generation and magnetic field integrity.
  3. **Flight Control Test:** Actuate all control systems and verify the flight computer is receiving correct data from all sensors.
  4. **Full-Power Ground Test:** Secure the vehicle to a test stand and conduct a full-power static thrust test.
