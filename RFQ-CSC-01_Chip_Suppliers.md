# Request for Quotation - RFQ-CSC-01

**To:** NVIDIA Corporation; Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; Intel Corporation
**From:** The Wardenclyffe Initiative, Strategic Sourcing Command
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Subject:** Request for Quotation: Custom AI-Powered Control & Synchronization SoC

--- 

### 1. Introduction

The Wardenclyffe Initiative is requesting quotations for the design, fabrication, and high-volume supply of a custom System-on-a-Chip (SoC). This component, the "Wardenclyffe Sync-Chip, Mark I" (WSC-1), will serve as the central control unit for our residential wireless power receivers. The WSC-1 must provide ultra-precise frequency locking, AI-driven performance optimization, and robust security.

We are soliciting bids from the world's leading semiconductor firms to become a pivotal partner in this national infrastructure project.

### 2. Technical Specifications

The WSC-1 is envisioned as a low-power, high-performance SoC with the following core functions:

*   **Primary Function:** Real-time, high-precision Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to maintain a stable lock on the 60 kHz wireless power transmission signal.
*   **AI/ML Core:** A dedicated, low-wattage Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to run a proprietary machine learning model. This model will predict and actively compensate for atmospheric interference and minor frequency drift, maximizing power transfer efficiency.
*   **Security Processor:** An integrated, hardware-level cryptographic engine supporting AES-256 encryption. This is critical for performing a secure handshake with the transmitter network to authenticate the receiver and prevent unauthorized energy tapping.
*   **System Management:** Must manage the state of the receiver's rectifier and inverter components and interface with the unit's safety cutoff mechanisms.
*   **Form Factor:** A compact System-on-a-Chip (SoC) package suitable for automated, high-volume PCB assembly.

### 3. Production Volume & Timeline

This RFQ covers the complete production run required for a full national deployment.

*   **Total Required Volume:** 140,000,000 units.
*   **Production Ramp-Up:**
    *   **Year 1:** 1,000,000 units.
    *   **Year 2-6:** 25,800,000 units per year.

### 4. Information Requested

Please provide the following information in your formal response:

1.  **Pricing Structure:**
    *   A detailed quote for the non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs associated with the design, tape-out, and validation of this custom SoC.
    *   Unit pricing tiers for the fabricated chip at volumes of 1M, 10M, and 25M+ units per year.
2.  **Development & Fab Timeline:** A detailed project plan outlining the timeline for design, prototyping, first silicon, and ramp-up to mass production.
3.  **Technical Proposal:** A brief overview of your proposed architecture to meet the specified requirements, including the choice of process node and NPU architecture.
4.  **Security Assurance:** Details on your secure silicon manufacturing and supply chain practices.
