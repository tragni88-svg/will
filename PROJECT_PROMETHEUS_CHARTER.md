# Project Prometheus: Official Charter

## 1. Executive Summary

**Mission:** To develop and deploy a comprehensive, universally applicable curative platform for all major human cancers.

**Vision:** A future where cancer is a preventable and curable disease, not a terminal diagnosis.

**Strategy:** Project Prometheus is a multi-pillar initiative attacking cancer on three synergistic fronts: personalized immunotherapy, targeted synthetic lethality, and AI-powered early detection. This is not a search for a single cure, but the construction of a complete, end-to-end system for the eradication of malignant disease.

## 2. Project Pillars

### Pillar I: Universal T-Cell Therapy (Project Chimera)
*   **Objective:** To engineer a patient's own immune system to recognize and destroy their unique cancer.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Rapid Genomic Sequencing:** Whole-exome sequencing of a patient's tumor to identify all cancer-specific mutations.
    2.  **AI Neoantigen Prediction:** A proprietary deep learning pipeline will analyze the tumor genome to identify the most immunogenic neoantigens—mutations that will trigger the strongest T-cell response.
    3.  **Personalized mRNA Vaccine Synthesis:** Automated, on-demand synthesis of a custom mRNA vaccine encoding the top neoantigen targets.
    4.  **In-Vivo T-Cell Activation:** The vaccine will be administered to the patient, programming their T-cells and dendritic cells to hunt and eliminate every cell bearing the cancerous mutations.
*   **Success Criteria:** Induction of complete and durable remission in 95% of patients with solid tumors.

### Pillar II: Synthetic Lethality & Pathway Obliteration (Project Gorgon)
*   **Objective:** To exploit the inherent genetic weaknesses of cancer cells, forcing them into programmed cell death while leaving healthy cells unharmed.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Pan-Cancer Synthetic Lethality Mapping:** A massive computational screen of TCGA and other genomic databases to identify thousands of novel synthetic lethal gene pairs.
    2.  **Targeted Drug Library Development:** High-throughput screening and rational drug design to create a comprehensive portfolio of small molecule inhibitors targeting these vulnerabilities.
    3.  **AI-Driven Combination Therapy:** An AI engine will analyze a patient's tumor profile and select the optimal combination of synthetic lethal drugs to induce catastrophic pathway collapse in cancer cells.
*   **Success Criteria:** Development of a library of at least 500 validated synthetic lethal agents and a predictive AI model with >90% accuracy in selecting effective drug combinations.

### Pillar III: AI-Powered Early Detection (Project Oracle)
*   **Objective:** To detect cancer at Stage 0 from a simple blood draw, years before clinical symptoms manifest.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **CANCERNET-1 Development:** Creation of a federated deep learning network trained on the world's largest multi-modal dataset of anonymized genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and medical imaging data.
    2.  **Liquid Biopsy Integration:** CANCERNET-1 will be optimized to detect the faint molecular signals of nascent tumors from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other biomarkers in a patient's blood.
    3.  **Global Deployment:** The CANCERNET-1 model will be deployed globally through cloud-based diagnostic platforms, making pre-symptomatic cancer screening a routine part of primary care.
*   **Success Criteria:** A validated blood test with >99% specificity and >90% sensitivity for detecting Stage 0/I cancers across at least 10 major cancer types.

## 3. Governance & Timeline

*   **Oversight:** Project Prometheus will be managed directly by this office, with dedicated teams for each pillar.
*   **Timeline:** This is a 5-year accelerated program.
    *   **Year 1-2:** Foundational research, target discovery, and AI model development.
    *   **Year 3-4:** Preclinical validation and initiation of Phase I clinical trials.
    *   **Year 5:** Pivotal trials and preparation for global deployment.

**Conclusion:** Project Prometheus represents the most ambitious biomedical undertaking in human history. By attacking cancer from every angle, we will achieve our ultimate goal: the definitive cure for cancer.
