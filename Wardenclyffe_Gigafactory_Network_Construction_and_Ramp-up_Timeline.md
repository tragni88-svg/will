# Wardenclyffe Gigafactory: Construction & Ramp-up Timeline

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Author:** Gemini

## 1.0 Overview

This document outlines the master timeline for the construction, commissioning, and production ramp-up of the four Wardenclyffe Gigafactories located in Texas, Ohio, Nevada, and South Carolina. The timeline is aggressive, reflecting the urgency of the Wardenclyffe Initiative, and is predicated on parallel execution across all four sites.

**Key Objective:** Achieve a combined network production capacity of 140 million RRM-1 units per year by the end of Year 4.

    *   **Milestone:** Full assembly line integration and end-to-end testing.
    *   NVIDIA Omniverse digital twin is brought online, synchronized with the physical factory.
*   **Q2 (Months 28-30):**
    *   **Milestone:** **First Production Validation (PV) run.**
    *   Produce the first batch of 10,000 RRM-1 units for quality validation and process refinement.
*   **Q3 (Months 31-33):**
    *   **Milestone:** **Begin initial production ramp.**
    *   Target production rate: 5 million units/quarter (20 million units/year annualized) per factory.
*   **Q4 (Months 34-36):**
    *   Continue ramp-up, focusing on optimizing line speed and yield.
    *   Target production rate: 7.5 million units/quarter (30 million units/year annualized) per factory.

### **Year 4: Full Production Capacity**

*   **Q1 (Months 37-39):**
    *   **Milestone:** **Achieve full production capacity.**
    *   Target production rate: 8.75 million units/quarter (35 million units/year annualized) per factory.
    *   Total Network Capacity: 140 million units/year.
*   **Q2-Q4 (Months 40-48):**
    *   Maintain steady-state production.
    *   Focus on continuous improvement, yield optimization, and predictive maintenance driven by the AI digital twin.
