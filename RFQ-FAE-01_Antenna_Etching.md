# Request for Quotation - RFQ-FAE-01

**To:** Foxconn Technology Group; Jabil Inc.
**From:** The Wardenclyffe Initiative, Strategic Sourcing Command
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Subject:** Request for Quotation: High-Volume, High-Precision Fractal Antenna Etching

---

### 1. Introduction

The Wardenclyffe Initiative is requesting quotations for the high-volume, precision etching of a copper fractal antenna pattern onto a customer-supplied metamaterial substrate. This is a follow-on process to our substrate fabrication and is a critical step in the assembly of our residential power receiver.

### 2. Technical Specifications

*   **Process:** High-fidelity photolithography and copper etching.
*   **Substrate:** The process must be compatible with the **Resonant Receiver Substrate, Mark I**, supplied by PARC. Substrate dimensions are 450mm x 450mm x 3mm.
*   **Pattern:** A proprietary, high-complexity fractal pattern (design files will be provided under NDA).
*   **Conductivity:** The etched copper must meet stringent conductivity and impedance specifications to ensure proper resonant performance.
*   **Adhesion:** The process must guarantee perfect adhesion of the copper to the metamaterial substrate under all operating temperatures.

### 3. Production Volume

*   **Total Required Volume:** 140,000,000 etched substrates.
*   **Production Ramp-Up:** Aligned with our Gigafactory production schedule, starting with 1,000,000 units in Year 1 and ramping to 25,800,000 units per year.

### 4. Information Requested

1.  **Price Per Etching:** A detailed price-per-unit for the etching process.
2.  **Process & Quality:** An overview of your proposed etching and quality control process to ensure pattern fidelity and conductivity.
3.  **Logistics:** A plan for receiving, processing, and shipping the substrates to our Gigafactory locations.

**Response Deadline:** Please submit your formal response by March 25, 2026.
