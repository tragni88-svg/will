# Request for Quotation - RFQ-MTS-01

**To:** Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), Advanced Materials Division
**From:** The Wardenclyffe Initiative, Strategic Sourcing Command
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Subject:** Request for Quotation: High-Volume Production of Custom Metamaterial Substrates

--- 

### 1. Introduction

The Wardenclyffe Initiative is undertaking a national infrastructure project to deploy a wireless power grid across the United States. A core component of our residential receiver unit is a highly specialized metamaterial substrate designed for optimal resonant energy capture. 

We have identified PARC as a global leader in metamaterial research and fabrication. We are hereby formally requesting a quotation for the exclusive, high-volume production of the substrate detailed below.

--- 

### 2. Technical Specifications

The required component is a flat, rigid substrate with the following properties:

*   **Designation:** Resonant Receiver Substrate, Mark I
*   **Dimensions:** 450mm x 450mm x 3mm (tolerance ± 0.1mm)
*   **Material Composition:** Proprietary negative-permittivity metamaterial composite.
*   **Resonant Frequency:** Must exhibit maximum energy absorption characteristics precisely at **60 kHz**.
*   **Surface Properties:** The "A" surface must be prepared for high-fidelity copper fractal etching via photolithography.
*   **Durability:** Must remain stable and within specification across a temperature range of -40°C to 85°C.

### 4. Information Requested

Please provide the following information in your response:

1.  **Unit Pricing Tiers:** We request a detailed price-per-unit based on the following annual volumes:
    *   1,000,000 units
    *   10,000,000 units
    *   25,000,000+ units
2.  **Production Feasibility:** Confirmation that PARC possesses the technical capability and capacity to meet the specified production volumes.
3.  **Lead Time:** Estimated lead time from purchase order to first delivery for the initial 1 million unit run.
4.  **Quality Assurance:** An overview of your proposed quality control and testing procedures to ensure each substrate meets the precise resonant frequency requirements.
