# Project Galatea: Hyper-Realistic Humanoid Architecture

**Mission:** To engineer the software and control systems for a humanoid robot that achieves indistinguishable realism in motion, interaction, and presence.

## 1. Core Philosophy: The Uncanny Valley Bridge
To cross the "Uncanny Valley," we must move beyond robotic precision. Humans are imperfect, fluid, and reactive. Galatea will prioritize **biomimetic noise** (subtle shifts, micro-movements) over perfect path planning.

## 2. Technical Pillars

### A. The Cognitive Engine (Mind)
*   **LLM Integration:** Real-time conversational AI (leveraging Project Synapse insights).
*   **Contextual Memory:** Remembering past interactions to build rapport.
*   **Emotional State Machine:** Internal variables (joy, stress, curiosity) that influence response latency and tone.

### B. Biomimetic Control (Body)
*   **Soft-Robotics Simulation:** Control algorithms that model muscles rather than motors (Series Elastic Actuators).
*   **Procedural Animation:** Generating gestures on the fly based on speech sentiment.
*   **Gaze Tracking:** Realistic eye movement (saccades) that focuses on the user's eyes and relevant objects.

### C. Sensory Fusion (Senses)
*   **Haptic Feedback Loop:** Processing touch pressure to adjust movement force (gentleness).
*   **Audio Localization:** Turning the head naturally toward sound sources.

## 3. Phase 1 Roadmap: The "Presence" Prototype
1.  **Kinematic Simulation:** A Python-based simulation of a human arm/hand executing fluid, non-linear movements.
2.  **Micro-Expression Driver:** A system to map emotional states to servo positions for facial muscles.
3.  **Voice-to-Gesture Engine:** Analyzing speech audio to auto-generate hand movements.

## 4. Hardware Abstraction Layer
*   Support for high-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) animatronic heads.
*   Integration with synthetic skin actuator arrays.
