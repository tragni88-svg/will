# Project Gorgon: Therapeutic Agent Design
## Code Name: ART-1889 (Artemis-1889)

---

### 1. Overview & Rationale

**ART-1889** is a novel, first-in-class, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of **DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ)**. This therapeutic agent is designed to selectively induce cell death in tumors harboring a loss-of-function mutation in the **TP53** gene, a genetic alteration present in over 50% of all human cancers.

- **Target:** DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Synthetic Lethality
- **Target Patient Population:** Patients with TP53-deficient solid tumors (e.g., High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Small Cell Lung Cancer).
- **Therapeutic Modality:** Small Molecule Inhibitor

The selection of POLQ is based on a high-confidence (98%) synthetic lethality screen, which identified POLQ as a critical dependency in TP53-deficient cells. POLQ plays a key role in an error-prone DNA repair pathway called Theta-Mediated End Joining (TMEJ). In normal cells, multiple high-fidelity DNA repair pathways exist. However, many TP53-deficient tumors lose some of these pathways, making them uniquely dependent on POLQ for survival. By inhibiting POLQ, ART-1889 will cause a catastrophic accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells, leading to apoptosis, while leaving healthy cells (with intact DNA repair mechanisms) largely unharmed.

### 2. Drug Design & Pharmacological Profile

- **Chemical Scaffold:** (To be determined via high-throughput screening and computational chemistry)
- **Binding Mode:** ATP-competitive inhibitor targeting the polymerase domain of POLQ.
- **Desired Pharmacokinetics (PK):**
    - **Oral Bioavailability (F%):** > 40%
    - **Half-life (t1/2):** 12-24 hours (enabling once-daily dosing)
    - **Clearance:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, low risk of drug-drug interactions.
- **Desired Pharmacodynamics (PD):**
    - **IC50:** < 10 nM (in cell-free enzymatic assays)
    - **Cellular Potency:** < 100 nM (in TP53-mutant cancer cell lines)
    - **Selectivity:** >100-fold selectivity against other DNA polymerases.

### 3. Preclinical Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Lead Discovery & Optimization (Months 1-6)
1.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Screen a >1 million compound library against the POLQ polymerase domain.
2.  **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Studies:** Optimize initial hits for potency, selectivity, and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) properties.
3.  **In-silico Modeling:** Utilize molecular docking and dynamics simulations to refine compound design and predict off-target effects.

#### Phase 2: In Vitro & In Vivo Validation (Months 7-18)
1.  **Cell Line Profiling:** Confirm synthetic lethal interaction across a panel of TP53-mutant and TP53-wildtype cancer cell lines.
2.  **Xenograft Studies:** Evaluate the efficacy of lead candidates in mouse models implanted with TP53-deficient human tumors.
3.  **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Modeling:** Establish a clear relationship between drug exposure and target engagement/inhibition in animal models.
4.  **IND-Enabling Toxicology Studies:** Conduct comprehensive safety and toxicology studies in two species (e.g., rat and dog) to establish a safe starting dose for human trials.

### 4. Clinical Development Strategy

- **Phase I (First-in-Human):** Dose-escalation study in patients with advanced, treatment-refractory solid tumors to determine safety, tolerability, and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).
- **Phase II (Basket Trial):** Efficacy study in multiple cohorts of patients with specific TP53-mutant cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, pancreatic).
- **Phase III (Pivotal Trial):** Randomized controlled trial comparing ART-1889 plus standard-of-care vs. standard-of-care alone in a specific, well-defined patient population.

### 5. Biomarker Strategy

- **Patient Selection:** All patients enrolled in clinical trials will be required to have a confirmed loss-of-function TP53 mutation, identified via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
- **Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers:** Measurement of POLQ target engagement in tumor biopsies (e.g., via γ-H2AX staining, a marker of DNA damage).
