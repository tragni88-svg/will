# Official Response to RFQ-MTS-01

**To:** The Wardenclyffe Initiative, Strategic Sourcing Command
**From:** Dr. Evelyn Reed, VP of Commercialization, Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)
**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Subject:** Response to RFQ-MTS-01 Regarding High-Volume Metamaterial Substrate Production

--- 

### 1. Summary

Dear Wardenclyffe Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to bid on what is unequivocally the most ambitious manufacturing project of our time. After a thorough review by our materials science and fabrication teams, we are confident that PARC possesses the unique capability to produce the **Resonant Receiver Substrate, Mark I** to your exact specifications. 

However, we must stress that the required scale is unprecedented and will necessitate the construction of a dedicated, fully-automated fabrication facility. Our quotation reflects this reality.

### 2. Production Feasibility

PARC confirms that the proposed metamaterial is technically feasible. Our existing laboratory-scale processes can achieve the desired resonant properties at 60 kHz. Scaling this to the requested volume is a significant but achievable engineering challenge. To meet your timeline, PARC proposes the construction of a new, co-funded **"Metamaterial Foundry"** adjacent to one of your planned Gigafactory locations (preferably Gigafactory Nevada).

### 3. Unit Pricing Tiers

The following pricing is contingent on a 5-year, binding supply agreement and co-investment in the new foundry.

| Annual Volume         | Price Per Unit (USD) |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1,000,000 units       | **$385.00**          |
| 10,000,000 units      | **$240.00**          |
| 25,000,000+ units     | **$175.00**          |

*   **Total Project Cost (Substrate Only):** At a blended average cost, the 140 million unit run is estimated at **$25.5 Billion USD**.

### 4. Lead Time & Quality Assurance

*   **Lead Time:** From the signing of the agreement and initial capital injection, we project a **22-month lead time** to construct the foundry and deliver the first 1 million units.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Every substrate will undergo a non-destructive, automated testing process. This includes laser-interferometry scanning for dimensional accuracy and a sweep of a low-power RF field to confirm the resonant frequency of each unit is within a 0.01% tolerance of the 60 kHz target.

### 5. Conclusion

PARC is prepared to become a cornerstone partner in the Wardenclyffe Initiative. The costs are significant, but we believe the final product will be a triumph of materials science and advanced manufacturing. We await your decision and are prepared to move forward immediately.

Sincerely,

Dr. Evelyn Reed
