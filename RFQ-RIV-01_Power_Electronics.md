# Request for Quotation - RFQ-RIV-01

**To:** Siemens AG; ABB Ltd; Schneider Electric SE
**From:** The Wardenclyffe Initiative, Strategic Sourcing Command
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Subject:** Request for Quotation: High-Volume Solid-State Power Conversion Module

--- 

### 1. Introduction

The Wardenclyffe Initiative is requesting quotations for the high-volume supply of a custom-designed Power Conversion Module (PCM-1). This module is a critical component in our residential wireless power receivers. Its function is to efficiently convert the high-frequency power captured by the receiver's antenna into standard, grid-quality household electricity.

We are soliciting bids from established leaders in power electronics to deliver a solution that is safe, reliable, and highly efficient at an unprecedented scale.

### 2. Technical Specifications

The PCM-1 must be a fully integrated, solid-state power electronics module with the following performance characteristics:

*   **Designation:** Power Conversion Module, Mark I (PCM-1)
*   **Primary Function:** To rectify incoming ~60 kHz AC power and invert it to a pure sine wave 60 Hz AC output.
*   **Input:** ~60 kHz AC, variable voltage and current.
*   **Output:** Split-phase 120V/240V AC, 60 Hz, with a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of less than 2%.
*   **Power Rating:** 
    *   **Continuous:** 15 kW
    *   **Peak Load:** 25 kW for up to 10 seconds.
*   **Target Efficiency:** Greater than 98% end-to-end conversion efficiency.
*   **Thermal Management:** Must be designed for reliable, long-term operation with passive cooling inside a sealed enclosure.
*   **Control Interface:** Must accept control signals from the master System-on-a-Chip (NVIDIA WSC-1) for performance regulation and emergency shutoff.
*   **Safety & Certification:** The design must meet or exceed all applicable UL and National Electrical Code (NEC) standards for power distribution equipment.
